### Purpose/motivation
Do other states with similar laws to prop 18, which would allow 17 year olds to vote in primaries if they will be 18 during the general election, experience noticeable changes in political lean before and after passage of this kind of law? 

We felt that any law that may increase voter participation among a specific demographic would find opposition among some political interest because greater voter participation among a demographic could push a locationâ€™s political makeup in the direction of one party or another. We thought examining how margin of victory, or political lean, would provide insight into whether adding this new group of voters would noticeably change the political landscape.
